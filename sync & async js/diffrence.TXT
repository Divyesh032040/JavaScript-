* Synchronous (Sync) JavaScript:

 -> In synchronous code, tasks are executed one after the other in a sequential manner.
Each task must finish before the next one starts.

 -> If there's a time-consuming operation (like fetching data from a server), the entire execution is blocked until that operation is completed.

 -> Synchronous code is straightforward to read and understand, but it can lead to a slower user experience if tasks take a significant amount of time


* Asynchronous (Async) JavaScript:

 
 -> In asynchronous code, tasks are initiated, but the execution doesn't wait for them to complete. Instead, it continues with the next tasks.

 -> Callback functions or Promises are used to handle the completion of asynchronous tasks.

  -> Asynchronous code is beneficial for handling operations that may take time (e.g., fetching data) without blocking the entire execution.

  -> It's commonly used in scenarios like AJAX requests, file reading, and other non-blocking operations
